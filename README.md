# TECHNOHACKS (Data Analytics)

## Introduction

This project aims to perform data cleaning, calculate summary statistics, and create visualizations using histograms or bar charts for a given dataset. The tasks are organized as follows:

1. Task 1: Data Cleaning
   - Remove missing values from the dataset.
   - Identify and handle outliers in the data.

2. Task 2: Calculate Summary Statistics
   - Calculate and present the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for the dataset.

3. Task 3: Visualization using Histogram
   - Create a histogram or bar chart to visualize the distribution of data in the dataset.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Jupyter Notebook

## Task 1: Data Cleaning

In this task, we clean the dataset by removing missing values and handling outliers. We use Python libraries like pandas and numpy for data manipulation.

**Instructions**:
- Execute the `data_cleaning.ipynb` notebook to perform data cleaning.
- This notebook will clean the dataset and provide a cleaned dataset as an output.

## Task 2: Calculate Summary Statistics

In this task, we calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for the cleaned dataset.

**Instructions**:
- Execute the `summary_statistics.ipynb` notebook to calculate summary statistics.
- The notebook will display the calculated statistics for the dataset.

## Task 3: Visualization using Histogram

In this task, we create a histogram or bar chart to visualize the distribution of data in the dataset.

**Instructions**:
- Execute the `data_visualization.ipynb` notebook to create a histogram or bar chart.
- The notebook will generate visualizations to help you understand the data distribution.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to perform data cleaning, calculate summary statistics, and create visualizations for a given dataset. It can be a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.
